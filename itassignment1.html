<h2> Personal profile </h2>
 <p> I am 20 years of age and have a limited knowledge of IT, all of which comes from my own investigative efforts on my parents home office computer, until I built my own computer mid 2020.</p>
 <p> My 4 month old kitten Marge, is almost a child to me. She loves to play with her little red mouse toy, which she LOVES playing fetch with, and no. I did not name her after The Simpsons.</p>

<h3>Interests</h3>
 <ul>
  <li> Sports - I have a history in Soccer, which I played when I was younger. I did eventually stop, but I do still follow the English Premier League, and I also love basketball. </li>
  <li> Video Games - I'm a fanatic for the E-Sports teams Fnatic in all forms. I've played Counter Strike: Global Offensive since I was 15, and I have recently quit playing League of Legends because it's trash. Recently I have been playing Osu! </li>
  <li> Music - Although i'm thoroughly invested and in love with music, I can't play any instruments aside from a small amount from my didgeridoo. My obsession with Kanye West led to me having his name put on my High School jersey, and I love Jimi Hendrix and the way he manipulated guitars to make out of world sounds. </li>
  <li> English - When writing, my English techniques and skills aren't written very well, but I believe I am a very well spoken individual face to face or over a voice call. OutKast, Wu-Tang Clan and MF Doom (Rappers) is really where my love of the English language came from. It's an amazing thing to witness people master words to give a few written lines so much meaning and emotion. </li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Education</h1>
  <p>My education levels don't exceed my High School Certificate as I am a recent HS graduate.
  But having some time off school has really made me want to go back and extend my knowledge of subjects I love, which is why I am currently writting this!
   High School Certificate (HSC) - Cessnock High School</p>

   <h2> Interest in IT </h2>
<p>
My interest in IT stems from a young age.
As a child, I would come home from school everyday (Then do my homework. Education is important kids!) and play flash games and PS2 games frequently.
That quickly developed into my discovery of the Steam Store, where I played more Team Fortress than i'd like to admit, and found so many different games of all sorts of varieties.
Playing so many different genres, I have found out that I love open world RPG's, First Person Shooter's and my overwhelming thrill I  get out of well developed indie Horror games.</p>

<p>
On my parents office computer, I would love to explore the windows operating system (OS) and find out what the capabilities of it was, and I would deeply investigate all of the options and settings.
Although, I do know my way around programs and software, if you put a gun to my head and asked me 'Why does the taskbar keep tasks on them' I could not tell you at all.
I do know that when someone tells you that "Alt + F4 will give you cheats", you should probably ignore them.
That being said, I do have some knowledge around hardware as I have put together my computer and taken apart many more previously.</p>

<p>
The reason I chose RMIT was due to RMIT's high notoriety of being a well developed and forward thinking educational option which could help me further pursue my desires of becoming a game developer.
Furthermore, the experience I have had so far has been amazing, the tutors and people involved are lovely, the students are friendly and well engaged and RMIT's OUA has openly given me a big stepping stone in my life. (Sucking Up pass me please I appreciate you all. Hard world out here y'all!) </p>

<p>
My expectations that come from my studies is to gain as much information about the future.
Information Technology and Programming are the courses I am studying, and I know that both of these subjects are already in our daily lives already, but the future holds so much more potential for these subjects. The more I can learn about these topics and my passion, then the world becomes my oyster. </p>

<h1> Ideal Job</h1>
<h2> Game Development </h2>
<p> Being introduced to video games by my uncles at such a young age really drove a passion in video games for me.
For this career path, to be a successful game developer, you need to have extensive knowledge of programming and game design.
Game design meaning that you need a good understanding of sound and graphics design, and having interests in music and an avid lover of video games, those parameters fit me well!
I intend on taking more courses in the future, which is why IT is a suitable course.
The web design aspect of IT can allow me to understand html code as well as web design in it's whole. </p>

<p> Knowing what technology has in store for me and what I have at my disposal and where to take it and the limits I can push it to.
Although I am not currently studying game design, I have the ability to make music on my own computer using FL Studio.
My goal by the end of the courses is to create my own indie game. Who knows, I could be the next Gaben Newell. </p>

<p> But to be realistic, I would love to have a stable job in game design in some company that creates any sort of game.
I plan on eventually finishing off my courses, start new courses with the intent to improve my game and music design and learn how to make a world feel more full.
I also plan on investing in a new computer to run Unreal Engine so I can just mess around with character designs and having fun with it while I still learn and work on a project. </p>

<h1> Turbulent Logician </h1>
<p> After using 16 personalities, it had decided that I am a Turbulent Logician. </p>
<img src="Logician.PNG">
<h1>Strengths</h1>
<p> This test and the other tests that I have taken have given me a little insight to who I am as a person, but it hasn't been anything mind blowing. I feel as if I have discovered an in-depth description of words that I would describe myself as.
Although this is this case, I have also found some useful information that I will refernce in the form of dot points and then go into how I feel about what "16Personalities" has described.</p>
<li>Great Analysts and Abstract Thinkers –
People with the Logician personality type view the world as a big, complex machine, and recognize that as with any machine, all parts are interrelated.
Logicians excel in analyzing these connections, seeing how seemingly unrelated factors tie in with each other in ways that bewilder most other personality types.</li>
<li> Open-Minded –
Logicians couldn’t make these connections if they thought they knew it all – they are highly receptive to alternate theories, so long as they’re supported by logic and facts. In more subjective matters like social norms and traditions, Logicians are usually fairly liberal, with a “none of my business” sort of attitude – peoples’ ideas are what matter.</li>
<p> These strengths are the ones that I have chosen from 16Personalities to describe me best. I believe I have the ability to keep an open mind about anything I do. Especially with people and working in groups. Allowing everybody to speak their opinions and ideas is a big part of having a team function without many hiccups.<p>
  <h1> Weaknesses </h1>
  <li> Insensitive –
Oftentimes Logician personalities get so caught up in their logic that they forget any kind of emotional consideration – they dismiss subjectivity as irrational and tradition as an attempt to bar much-needed progress.
Purely emotional situations are often utterly puzzling to Logicians, and their lack of timely sympathy can easily offend. </li>
<li> Very Private and Withdrawn –
While Logicians’ intellectualism yields many insights into their surroundings, their surroundings are ironically considered an intrusion on their thoughts.
This is especially true with people – Logicians are quite shy in social settings. More complicated situations such as parties exacerbate this, but even close friends struggle to get into Logicians’ hearts and minds.</li>
<p> These weaknesses described are fairly accurate in my opinon. Whereas I do trust myself being open minded, I am someone who will spill out something I shouldn't say or will hurt someones feelings. But I also believe honesty is the best policy.
  As of being private and withdrawn, I have even noticed this in my online RMIT work. I don't contribute to discussion forums as often as I should and I do have overwhelming anxiety a lot of the time. Tending to keep to myself isn't something that should be implemented into a group project but I am also working on these weaknesses with forms of psychology.</p>

<h1> Education Planner </h1>
<img src="Tactile.PNG">
<p> For the second test, I chose <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/"> Education Planner. </a> There are 20 questions they ask you to determine whether you are a Tacile Learner, Audible Learner or Visual Learner. They measure it in percentages as nobody is a single type of learner.</p>
<p> What this questionnaire suggest is that I am a Tacile and Visual learner. To which I completely agree with. Being a hands on, visual learner, I find that it's much easier to understand what I am doing by exploring things on my own efforts. But that being said, I do struggle with group efforts due to the fact that I prefer to be by myself during most tasks.
Although, group tasks aren't something that I stray from, but I do typically find it harder to work with groups as most of my experiences with group tasks have been dependant on each persons ability to do a task and not so much to do with team-work.</p>
