<h1>Hi! My name is Brendan Lawler</h1>

<h2> Personal profile </h2>
<p> For those who are interested, I am an Indigenous Aboriginal man from the Kamilaroi tribe. Although I do know my heritage, I wasn't born in Quirindi where my tribe is centralized, but I am from the Hunter Valley in New South Wales.</p>
<p> I am 20 years of age and have a limited knowledge of IT, all of which comes from my own investigative efforts on my parents home office computer, until I built my own computer mid 2020.</p>
<p> My 4 month old kitten Marge, is almost a child to me. She loves to play with her little red mouse toy, which she LOVES playing fetch with, and no. I did not name her after The Simpsons. :()</p>

<h1>Interests</h1>
<ul>
<li> Sports - I have a history in Soccer, which I played when I was younger. I did eventually stop, but I do still follow the English Premier League, and I also love basketball. </li>
<li> Video Games - I'm a fanatic for the E-Sports teams Fnatic in all forms. I've played Counter Strike: Global Offensive since I was 15, and I have recently quit playing League of Legends because it's trash. Recently I have been playing Osu! </li>
<li> Music - Although i'm thoroughly invested and in love with music, I can't play any instruments aside from a small amount from my didgeridoo. My obsession with Kanye West led to me having his name put on my High School jersey, and I love Jimi Hendrix and the way he manipulated guitars to make out of world sounds. </li>
<li> English - When writing, my English techniques and skills aren't written very well, but I believe I am a very well spoken individual face to face or over a voice call.OutKast, Wu-Tang Clan and MF Doom (Rappers) is really where my love of the English language came from. It's an amazing thing to witness people master words to give a few written lines so much meaning and emotion. </li>
